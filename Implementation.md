The implementation of android app is done in Android studio platform which uses JAVA and XML language. For machine learning Neural network algorithms are done in Google Colaboratory or colab in Python programming. The testing of the app is done by Pixel_3a_API_30_x86, it is a virtual device known as Android Emulator.
